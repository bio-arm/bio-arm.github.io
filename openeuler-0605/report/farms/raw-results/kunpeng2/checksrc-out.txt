FARMS Package Version 1.53.0


Changes in FARMS:
For all changes previous to 1.3.0, see the farms vignette.
Version 1.3.0: Added I/NI-calls for filtering
               Adjusted Hyperparameters for alternative CDFs,
               probes set standardized, weighted mean
               Works now with R >= 2.8 and Bioconductor 2.3,
               Changed termination criterion, initialization values,
               factors and loadings scaled, added argument robust
               Update for R-2.11
               Updated I/NI-Call for Laplace-FARMS version,
               Maximum likelihood correlation structure given
               non-negative constraints
Version 1.4.0: Default centering changed to median
Version 1.8.x: Suppression of spurious correlation (Laplace-FARMS)
