_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     These functions implements a faster calculation of (weighted)
     Pearson correlation.

     The speedup against the R&#x27;s standard ‘cor’ function will be
     substantial particularly if the input matrix only contains a small
     number of missing data. If there are no missing data, or the
     missing data are numerous, the speedup will be smaller.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     cor(x, y = NULL, 
         use = &quot;all.obs&quot;, 
         method = c(&quot;pearson&quot;, &quot;kendall&quot;, &quot;spearman&quot;),

         verbose = 0, indent = 0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a numeric vector or a matrix. If ‘y’ is null, ‘x’ must be a
          matrix.

       y: a numeric vector or a matrix. If not given, correlations of
          columns of ‘x’ will be calculated.

     use: a character string specifying the handling of missing data.
          The fast calculations currently support ‘&quot;all.obs&quot;’ and
          ‘&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;’; for other options, see R&#x27;s
          standard correlation function ‘cor’.  Abbreviations are
          allowed.

  method: a character string specifying the method to be used. Fast
          calculations are currently available only for ‘&quot;pearson&quot;’.

weights.x: optional observation weights for ‘x’. A matrix of the same
          dimensions as ‘x’, containing non-negative weights. Only used
          in fast calculations: ‘methods’ must be ‘&quot;pearson&quot;’ and ‘use’
          must be one of ‘&quot;all.obs&quot;, &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;’.

weights.y: optional observation weights for ‘y’. A matrix of the same
          dimensions as ‘y’, containing non-negative weights. Only used
          in fast calculations: ‘methods’ must be ‘&quot;pearson&quot;’ and ‘use’
          must be one of ‘&quot;all.obs&quot;, &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;’.

   quick: real number between 0 and 1 that controls the precision of
          handling of missing data in the calculation of correlations.
          See details.

  cosine: logical: calculate cosine correlation? Only valid for
          ‘method=&quot;pearson&quot;’. Cosine correlation is similar to Pearson
          correlation but the mean subtraction is not performed. The
          result is the cosine of the angle(s) between (the columns of)
          ‘x’ and ‘y’.

 cosineX: logical: use the cosine calculation for ‘x’? This setting
          does not affect ‘y’ and can be used to give a hybrid
          cosine-standard correlation.

 cosineY: logical: use the cosine calculation for ‘y’? This setting
          does not affect ‘x’ and can be used to give a hybrid
          cosine-standard correlation.

    drop: logical: should the result be turned into a vector if it is
          effectively one-dimensional?

nThreads: non-negative integer specifying the number of parallel
          threads to be used by certain parts of correlation
          calculations.  This option only has an effect on systems on
          which a POSIX thread library is available (which currently
          includes Linux and Mac OSX, but excludes Windows). If zero,
          the number of online processors will be used if it can be
          determined dynamically, otherwise correlation calculations
          will use 2 threads.  Note that this option does not affect
          what is usually the most expensive part of the calculation,
          namely the matrix multiplication. The matrix multiplication
          is carried out by BLAS routines provided by R; these can be
          sped up by installing a fast BLAS and making R use it.

 verbose: Controls the level of verbosity. Values above zero will cause
          a small amount of diagnostic messages to be printed.

  indent: Indentation of printed diagnostic messages. Each unit above
          zero adds two spaces.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The fast calculations are currently implemented only for
     ‘method=&quot;pearson&quot;’ and ‘use’ either ‘&quot;all.obs&quot;’ or
     ‘&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;’.  The ‘corFast’ function is a wrapper
     that calls the function ‘cor’. If the combination of ‘method’ and
     ‘use’ is implemented by the fast calculations, the fast code is
     executed; otherwise, R&#x27;s own correlation ‘cor’ is executed.

     The argument ‘quick’ specifies the precision of handling of
     missing data. Zero will cause all calculations to be executed
     precisely, which may be significantly slower than calculations
     without missing data. Progressively higher values will speed up
     the calculations but introduce progressively larger errors.
     Without missing data, all column means and variances can be
     pre-calculated before the covariances are calculated. When missing
     data are present, exact calculations require the column means and
     variances to be calculated for each covariance. The approximate
     calculation uses the pre-calculated mean and variance and simply
     ignores missing data in the covariance calculation. If the number
     of missing data is high, the pre-calculated means and variances
     may be very different from the actual ones, thus potentially
     introducing large errors.  The ‘quick’ value times the number of
     rows specifies the maximum difference in the number of missing
     entries for mean and variance calculations on the one hand and
     covariance on the other hand that will be tolerated before a
     recalculation is triggered. The hope is that if only a few missing
     data are treated approximately, the error introduced will be small
     but the potential speedup can be significant.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The matrix of the Pearson correlations of the columns of ‘x’ with
     columns of ‘y’ if ‘y’ is given, and the correlations of the
     columns of ‘x’ if ‘y’ is not given.

_N_o_t_e:

     The implementation uses the BLAS library matrix multiplication
     function for the most expensive step of the calculation. Using a
     tuned, architecture-specific BLAS may significantly improve the
     performance of this function.

     The values returned by the corFast function may differ from the
     values returned by R&#x27;s function ‘cor’ by rounding errors on the
     order of 1e-15.

     Given a set of p-values, returns p-values adjusted using one of

     #   &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;none&quot;)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       p: numeric vector of p-values (possibly with ‘NA’s).  Any other
          R object is coerced by ‘as.numeric’.

  method: correction method, a ‘character’ string.  Can be abbreviated.

       n: number of comparisons, must be at least ‘length(p)’; only set
          this (to non-default) when you know what you are doing!

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The adjustment methods include the Bonferroni correction
     (‘&quot;bonferroni&quot;’) in which the p-values are multiplied by the
     number of comparisons.  Less conservative corrections are also
     included by Holm (1979) (‘&quot;holm&quot;’), Hochberg (1988)
     (‘&quot;hochberg&quot;’), Hommel (1988) (‘&quot;hommel&quot;’), Benjamini &amp; Hochberg
     (1995) (‘&quot;BH&quot;’ or its alias ‘&quot;fdr&quot;’), and Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli
     (2001) (‘&quot;BY&quot;’), respectively.  A pass-through option (‘&quot;none&quot;’)
     is also included.  The set of methods are contained in the
     ‘p.adjust.methods’ vector for the benefit of methods that need to
     have the method as an option and pass it on to ‘p.adjust’.

     The first four methods are designed to give strong control of the
     family-wise error rate.  There seems no reason to use the
     unmodified Bonferroni correction because it is dominated by Holm&#x27;s
     method, which is also valid under arbitrary assumptions.

     Hochberg&#x27;s and Hommel&#x27;s methods are valid when the hypothesis
     tests are independent or when they are non-negatively associated
     (Sarkar, 1998; Sarkar and Chang, 1997).  Hommel&#x27;s method is more
     powerful than Hochberg&#x27;s, but the difference is usually small and
     the Hochberg p-values are faster to compute.

     The ‘&quot;BH&quot;’ (aka ‘&quot;fdr&quot;’) and ‘&quot;BY&quot;’ methods of Benjamini,
     Hochberg, and Yekutieli control the false discovery rate, the
     expected proportion of false discoveries amongst the rejected
     hypotheses.  The false discovery rate is a less stringent
     condition than the family-wise error rate, so these methods are
     more powerful than the others.

     Note that you can set ‘n’ larger than ‘length(p)’ which means the
     unobserved p-values are assumed to be greater than all the
     observed p for ‘&quot;bonferroni&quot;’ and ‘&quot;holm&quot;’ methods and equal to 1
     for the other methods.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A numeric vector of corrected p-values (of the same length as ‘p’,
     with names copied from ‘p’).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     diffcoexp function identifies differentially coexpressed links
     (DCLs) and differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs). DCLs are gene
     pairs with significantly different correlation coefficients under
     two conditions (de la Fuente 2010, Jiang et al., 2016). DCGs are
     genes with significantly more DCLs than by chance (Yu et al.,
     2011, Jiang et al., 2016). It takes two gene expression matrices
     or data frames under two conditions as input, calculates gene-gene
     correlations under two conditions and compare them with Fisher&#x27;s Z
     transformation, filter the correlation with the rth and qth and
     the correlation changes with r.diffth and q.diffth. It identifies
     DCGs using binomial probability model (Jiang et al., 2016).

     The main steps are as follows:

     a). Correlation coefficients and p values of all gene pairs under
     two conditions are calculated.

     b). The difference between the correlation coefficients under two
     conditions are calculated and the p value is calculated using
     Fisher&#x27;s Z-transformation.

     c). p values are adjusted.

     d). Gene pairs (links) coexpressed in at least one condition are
     identified using the criteria that at least one of the correlation
     coefficients under two conditions has absolute value greater than
     the threshold rth and adjusted p value less than the threshold
     qth. The links that meet the criteria are included in CLs.

     e). Differentially coexpressed gene pairs (links) are identified
     from CLs using the criteria that the absolute value of the
     difference between the two correlation coefficients is greater the
     threshold r.diffth and adjusted p value is less than the threshold
     q.diffth. The links that meet the criteria are included in DCLs.

     f). The DCLs are classified into three categories: &quot;same signed&quot;,
     &quot;diff signed&quot;, or &quot;switched opposites&quot;. &quot;same signed&quot; indicates
     that the gene pair has same signed correlation coefficients under
     both conditions. &quot;diff signed&quot; indicates that the gene pair has
     oppositely signed correlation coefficients under two conditions
     and only one of them meets the criteria that absolute correlation
     coefficient is greater than the threshold rth and adjusted p value
     less than the threshold qth. &quot;switched opposites&quot; indicates that
     the gene pair has oppositely signed correlation coefficients under
     two conditions and both of them meet the criteria that absolute
     correlation coefficient is greater than the threshold rth and
     adjusted p value less than the threshold qth.

     g). All the genes in DCLs are tested for their enrichment of DCLs,
     i.e, whether they have more DCLs than by chance using binomial
     probability model (Jiang et al., 2016). Those with adjusted p
     value less than the threshold q.dcgth are included in DCGs.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a list of two data frames.

     The DCGs data frame contains genes that contribute to
     differentially correlated links (gene pairs) with q value less
     than q.dcgth. It has the following columns:

  ‘Gene’: Gene ID

   ‘CLs’: Number of links with absolute correlation coefficient greater
          than rth and q value less than qth in at least one condition

  ‘DCLs’: Number of links that meet the criteria for CLs and the
          criteria that absolute difference between the correlation
          coefficients of the two condition is greater than r.diffth
          and q value less than q.diffth

‘DCL.same’: Number of subset of DCLs with same signed correlation
          coefficients in both conditions

‘DCL.diff’: Number of subset of DCLs with oppositely signed correlation
          coefficients under two conditions but only one of them has
          absolute correlation coefficient greater than rth and q value
          less than qth

‘DCL.switch’: Number of subset of DCLs with oppositely signed
          correlation coefficients under two conditions and both of
          them have absolute correlation coefficient greater than rth
          and q value less than qth

     ‘p’: p value of having &gt;=DCLs given CLs

     ‘q’: adjusted p value

     The DCLs data frame contains the differentially correlated links
     (gene pairs) that meet the criteria that at least one of their
     correlation coefficients (cor.1 and/or cor.2) is greater than rth
     with q value (q.1 and/or q.2) less than qth and the absolute value
     of the difference between the correlation coefficients under two
     conditions (cor.diff) is greater than r.diffth with q.diffcor less
     than q.diffth. It has the following columns:

‘Gene.1’: Gene ID

‘Gene.2’: Gene ID

 ‘cor.1’: correlation coefficients under condition 1

 ‘cor.2’: correlation coefficients under condition 2

‘cor.diff’: difference between correlation coefficients under condition
          2 and condition 1

   ‘p.1’: p value under null hypothesis that correlation coefficient
          under condition 1 equals to zero

   ‘p.2’: p value under null hypothesis that correlation coefficient
          under condition 2 equals to zero

‘p.diffcor’: p value under null hypothesis that difference between two
          correlation coefficients under two conditions equals to zero
          using Fisher&#x27;s r-to-Z transformation

   ‘q.1’: adjusted p value under null hypothesis that correlation
          coefficient under condition 1 equals to zero

   ‘q.2’: adjusted p value under null hypothesis that correlation
          coefficient under condition 2 equals to zero

‘q.diffcor’: adjusted p value under null hypothesis that the difference
          between two correlation coefficients under two conditions
          equals to zero using Fisher&#x27;s r-to-Z transformation

  ‘type’: can have value &quot;same signed&quot;, &quot;diff signed&quot;, or &quot;switched
          opposites&quot;. &quot;same signed&quot; indicates that the gene pair has
          same signed correlation coefficients under both conditions.
          &quot;diff signed&quot; indicates that the gene pair has oppositely
          signed correlation coefficients under two conditions and only
          one of them meets the criteria that absolute correlation
          coefficient is greater than rth and q value less than qth.
          &quot;switched opposites&quot; indicates that the gene pair has
          oppositely signed correlation coefficients under two
          conditions and both of them meet the criteria that absolute
          correlation coefficient is greater than rth and q value less
          than qth.
